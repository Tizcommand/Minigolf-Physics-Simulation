# Minigolf Physics Simulation
This minigolf physics simulation allows you to play minigolf by launching a ball of a spring, into a hole.
The movement of the ball is simulated using realistic physics.

downloading the repository and using the index.html file, stored in the src/index folder, with a browser of your choice.

Thanks go to my game physics teacher Dr.-Ing. Volkmar Naumburger for teaching me the physics, mathematics and logic behind this project.
